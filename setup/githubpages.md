## Setting up Github Pages

{: .warning}
We highly recommend GitHub Pages, but you're welcome to use another hosting solution for your assignments (e.g Vercel, self-hosting, etc.). However, if something goes wrong with your deployment, we won't be able to help.

{: .note}
Make sure your GitHub repository has already been set up. If not, see [Setting up your repository](githubrepo).

{: .warning}
Make sure your repository visibility is set to **public**, as deploying Github Pages from a private repository requires a premium subscription.
