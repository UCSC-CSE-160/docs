For all your assignments, you will use Github for your repository and Github Pages to create a live hosted submission. To get set up with that see [Setting up your repository](githubrepo) and [Setting up Github Pages](githubpages).

For all assignments you will also need to be able to preview your changes locally before deploying to Github Pages. For help with that, see [Local Setup](localsetup).

For Assignment 5 (and **ONLY** assignment 5) you will be using Three.js. To get set up with that, see [Three.js setup](threejs).
