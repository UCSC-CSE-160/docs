## Overview of the Labs
If this is your first lab, you will need to [create a CodeSandbox account](https://codesandbox.io/signin?continue=/dashboard) before starting the lab. You can sign in using any method you would like. 

Once you create your account, you are ready to start the lab.

## Starting The Lab
1. Open the CodeSandbox template link.

2. Before you work on the lab, the first thing you want to do after opening the CodeSandbox template link in the lab specification document is forking the template.
![fork the lab template](./images/fork.png)

3. Follow the lab document and work on the *fork* of the template.

4. Share the link to the lab clicking the share button in the top right. Change the permissions to either unlisted or public, and then click "copy".

{: .warning}
There is no need to convert the sandbox into a devbox. This takes significantly longer for us to grade. 

5. Submit the copied link along with any group members you may have worked with as a textbox in canvas. 

{: .warning}
Submitting incorrect links will result in penalties to your lab grade. If you do submit an incorrect link but fix it after the lab deadline, then please make a **Piazza** post, do not email specific graders as they may not be in charge of that lab.
